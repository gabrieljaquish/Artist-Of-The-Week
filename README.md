### History
Between 2005 and 2011 I ran a mobile DJ business, providing music, lighting, and announcments for Weddings, Retirements, Birthdays, county fairs, and all other manner of gathering. When you spend your weekends spinning (generally) the same hits over and over you tend to spend your weekdays searching for somthing different. Because lets be honest, your wedding playlist isn't that original, most of it is probably songs from on [Mobile Beat's Top 200 list](https://www.mobilebeat.com/top-200/), and that is totally fine. People love to dance to music they can sing along with.

In the winter of 2008 my brother introduced me to Spotify which materially changed the way I have consumed changed, but it wasn't until 2015 that I realized the way I **listen** to music had changed. During my childhood up thru highshool I tended to listen to Albums, start to finish, on Vinyl, 8-Track, CD, or even Digitally. Sure, DJing parties was song by song, but when i was home I liked to put on a record and sink into the album.

I work behind a desk, alot of times alone, and alot of times with headphones on, so in June of 2015 I decided to start a new tradition. Every Wednesday I would pick a new artist, read a bit about them, and Listen to all the albums and singles they had produced, start to finish, in cronological order. After I had listend to the artist's entire catalog, I would continue to listen to whatever songs or albums I liked best until the next Wednesday rolled around. Now i'm not going to claim this was a diciplined musical regiman each week, it wasn't and that wasn't the point. I would sometimes let myself wonder thru related artists, solo projects by band members, or even somthing different if I needed a break. 

It's a fun little journey thru the life of a particular band, artist or producer and gives you better insight into how they have changed and grown musically thru time, and I have stuck with it for 190 weeks as of this writing. 

### What is this repository for?
Given that I've been at this for awhile, I thought it might be time to start publishing and tracking who I am listening to each week. Maybe even record a little bit about each artist, like a fun fact, or a song I liked or disliked. 

Maybe somone else will find this idea intresting, or maybe I'll just be able to look back on who I liked best at a given period and see how my tastes have changed over time. 

### How Are You Going To Record it?
Good Question, and I don't have a good answer. 

To start I am going to give JSON a try, recording the Artist's Name, Dates I listened, and a favorite song each week. I'll pull the new artist into the master each Wednessday and publish the file out to [my website](https://www.gabrieljaquish.com)
